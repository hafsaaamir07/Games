 creating a simple 'quizzing system' similar to the quizzes you can participate in on social media sites like Facebook. 
 1) The program starts off by allowing the user to answer a series of at least 4 questions. 
 2) When the user clicks a button to submit their answers are sent to a PHP program to be tabulated and saved to the server. 
 3) The PHP page will then display the results of the quiz in a visually appealing way.
 
At any time the user can click on a hyperlink to view aggregate results for the quiz. 
If they click on this link a new PHP page will be loaded which will display a bar chart summary of all results that have been gathered so far.

In addition, every time a client takes the quiz their result should be saved as a cookie on the client's computer. 
if they choose to come back to the page they will see their previous result. They can elect to take the quiz again which start the process over again.
